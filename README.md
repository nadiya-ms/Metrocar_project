# Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project
## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing the customer funnel for the Metrocar company, a ride-sharing service similar to Uber or Lyft. Python was employed for the data analysis.

## Motivation
The project was undertaken to perform a detailed funnel analysis, targeting the identification of potential areas for improvement within Metrocar's customer journey. Specific business questions were addressed, insights for optimization were uncovered, and data-driven recommendations were provided.

The customer funnel was analyzed to pinpoint drop-off points and propose strategies for enhancement. By leveraging funnel analysis, the stages where users exit the funnel were identified, contributing to improved outcomes such as increased sales and higher conversion rates.

## The Project

## About Metrocar’s User Funnel
Metrocar is utilized as a ride-sharing intermediary, facilitating connections between riders and drivers through a mobile application designed for ease of use. The customer funnel is structured into stages including app download, signup, ride request, driver acceptance, ride completion, payment, and review submission. Drop-offs at each stage are analyzed to uncover opportunities for optimization.

## Business Questions
The following key business questions were addressed in the analysis:

* How can the funnel stages be optimized?
* What marketing insights can be derived based on platform usage?
* How do different age groups perform across the funnel?
* What strategies can improve the effectiveness of surge pricing?
* Which stage exhibits the lowest conversion rate?
    
## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that the company must address supply-demand imbalances during peak hours. The current shortages during these periods result in a high cancellation rate, as many customers are unwilling to wait for extended periods. To mitigate this issue, implementing a surge pricing strategy and offering ride-sharing options were recommended. The ride-sharing feature would also contribute to reducing CO₂ emissions by accommodating multiple users within a single journey.

Furthermore, it was identified that the majority of users utilize iOS devices and fall within the 35–44 age group, providing crucial demographic insights for targeted marketing and service improvements.

## Additional Insights 
During the analysis, the importance of understanding customer perspectives was highlighted. Sentiment analysis was conducted to assess customer reviews, focusing specifically on those with a 1-star rating. 
This preliminary review analysis identified factors potentially hindering the company’s growth. For example, certain recurring customer complaints were uncovered through sentiment scoring and by examining frequently used adjectives and nouns in reviews.

Based on these findings, conducting an in-depth sentiment analysis is strongly recommended. Such an analysis would enable the company to gain deeper insights into customer opinions, thereby facilitating more efficient service improvements and budget allocation.
